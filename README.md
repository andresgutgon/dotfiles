## dotfiles
========
This are the docfiles I use to set up my Terminal (iTerm).

## Copy & paste from Nvim to Mac OSX
Put in visual mode and select what you want. Then `+y` (Thanks ChatGPT ðŸ¤¯, I've
being living without this for years)

## iTerm
Go to Preferences (âŒ˜ + ,) > preferences and click the checkbox that says `Load preferences from a custom URL folder` then sync with a folder in your dotfiles. In my case it's called `iterm` how original.

## Terminal theme
https://github.com/mdo/ocean-terminal

## Dependencies
These packages need to be installed in Mac OS X

1. For Telescope: `brew install ripgrep`
2. For `nvim-spectre`: `brew install gnu-sed` & `brew install ripgrep`

## Nerd fonts
To setup a custom font (in this case Nerd Font) go to:
https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads
and download it. Install it with Mac OS X fonts and you're good to go.

Then if you're using iTerm go to Preferences (âŒ˜ + ,) > Profiles > Text > Font and select `Hack` as your terminal fornt.
Already done in my case because I store iTerm preferences in my dotfiles
